-- SAMPLE DATA WITHOUT USER DEPENDENCIES
-- ========================================

-- Note: Community posts and user-dependent data will be created when real users sign up
-- For now, we'll focus on data that doesn't require auth.users

-- All community posts, replies, and user-dependent data will be created when users sign up
-- The database structure is ready for:
-- - User profiles and authentication
-- - Community interactions and voting
-- - Crisis detection and notifications  
-- - Appointment booking with counselors
-- - Resource access and event registration

-- ========================================
-- SAMPLE COMMUNITY POSTS (commented out until users exist)
-- ========================================

-- These will be created when real users sign up and start using the platform
-- INSERT INTO public.community_posts (id, user_id, title, content, category, is_anonymous, is_moderated, upvote_count, downvote_count, reply_count) VALUES 
-- Community posts will be created when users sign up and engage with the platform

-- ========================================
-- SAMPLE EVENT REGISTRATIONS
-- ========================================

-- Add some sample registrations to show event popularity
UPDATE public.events 
SET current_attendees = CASE 
  WHEN title = 'Stress Management Workshop' THEN 15
  WHEN title = 'Mental Health Awareness Week: Opening Ceremony' THEN 87
  WHEN title = 'Peer Support Group: Anxiety Management' THEN 8
  WHEN title = 'Mindfulness and Meditation Session' THEN 12
  WHEN title = 'Academic Success and Mental Health Balance' THEN 23
  ELSE current_attendees

-- Assessment results will be created when users complete assessments
